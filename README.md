# guess-game

Try this game out here: https://gwensmith7.github.io/guess-game/ 

This was meant to look kind of old school and it was an early project in my JS course.

This was when I was first learning about the DOM and how I could target elements on the page.

I learned how to add/remove classes, show random numbers, keep track of a score in a variable.

I also decided to cap the guesses at 10.
